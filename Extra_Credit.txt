Question:
Discuss in your report ways in which you can reuse information between repeated, chained searches
in the same environment i.e., searches typically beginning from the goal of the previous search.

Through repeated searches on a single environment, we could store a taboo list of visited cells. Some cells will be visited more than others.
Take for exmaples the following environment:

1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Traveling from the LEFT side to the RIGHT size would cause us to visit the [3][2] cell every single time. 
If the agent starts at the TOP LEFT [0][0] corner and the goal is at the MIDDLE FAR RIGHT [1][6] position, 
then it would be faster to reach the most frequently used cell at [3][2] to create a shorter path than treating 
all cells equally through f = g + h.

To be more specific, when a cell is visited more often we can add some priority value to make better use of previous search experience.
The taboo list of cells would not only contain the visited cells, but how many times each cell was visited. The worst case scenario is that
we store every single cell (which is M x N cells) if all of them are being visited but this could only occur if there are no obstacles and
if we do enough searches to visit every single cell. As the agent examines its neighbors to calculate an action, we could modify the 
f = g + h function to incorporate the number of times visited as variable 'v' such that f = g + h + v. If this function does not result
in any significant changes then we could multiple v by some weighted value.

The taboo list could be optimized by turning it into a hashtable with a hashfunction based off of the position of the cell in our matrix 
of cells. This would allow us to check if the neighbors of the agent are in the table of visited nodes in O(1) time.




	Reusing information between repeated searches in the same environment can improve search times because by reusing information we can cut down of the processing required to find the most optimal path. The most simple case would be that where we start at point A and find a path to point B, and then our next search is the reverse from point B to A.

			
				0	0	0	D	0	0
				0	0	0	0	0	0	
				A	0	0	B	0	0
				0	0	0	0	0	0
				0	0	0	0	0	C	


 If we keep track of previously traveled paths, then all we have to do is retrieve the path found and travel it in reverse. This eliminates the need to actually redo the entire algorithm. 
	Another case where we can reuse a previously done search is where we must travel past a node that we have already traveled between.
In this example, it would be the one were you must travel from B to C, where C is past A. 
Rather than having to find a whole new path, we can use the path from B to A, and then start the algorithm from A to C. 
This is analogous to a highway where since we know that the highway would get us fairly close to our destination, we can just travel along it as far as we need, and from our “exit” resume our navigation. 
However, we could only have data between A and D, and need to go to C. 
If we reused the same path from A to D and from D to C, we would be going in the complete opposite way we need to go. 
To solve this, we could implement a heuristic where we get an estimate of the distance between the two points and have a threshold where we would rather save on the processing time than have the most optimal path.
